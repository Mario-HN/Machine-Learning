# Machine-Learn
Some of my research notebooks for the Detection of Parkinson disease via acoustic measures. Here you'll find data manipulation with pandas, supervised, unsupervised learning tecniques
and even a fine tuned neural net. Some stuff might be desorganized because i'm commiting this 2 years after the research was finished.
